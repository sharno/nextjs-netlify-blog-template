[The Mom Test](https://amzn.to/3Dsqlhu) is a book by **Rob Fitzpatrick** about talking to customers from the viewpoint of any kind of person who is trying to develop/sell a product. The book takes a really simple and entertaining approach to introduce its material, mostly with a conversation and a set of questions for potential customers. The mom test itself is a conversation that you can have with your mom about this product that you want to sell.

Rob starts the book with a conversation that probably many of us had with a relative or a friend at least considering a product or something that we want to sell. As a software engineer who tried to start multiple small side businesses, I had the same conversation with lots of people that I know. After reading the book the conversation actually feels na√Øve. As Rob actually puts it, you are just seeking emotional validation with such set of questions which are mostly just "**Do you like my idea?**" or "**Would you pay that much money to use this app I'm developing?**" and most of the people would simply answer "Yes!" because they are friends or relatives and they just want to make you happy.

The conversation that Rob rather recommends to have with mom or family or friends is more about open ended questions that try to extract an actual experience from the person you are talking with. Questions like "**What's the last thing you tried to solve such a problem?**" or "Why do you bother solving this problem" or "What did you pay to solve this problem?" are all more about past experiences and have more concrete answers that people cannot manipulate out of their love/hate for you. You can get more exposure to the problem that the people are really bothered by.

Another example that Rob gives is a story about finance people who were annoyed by how emails worked and they wanted "a better email" or "a better communication service". But when they were asked **why** do they need such a solution the answer was that they wanted to be sure that they are working on the latest version of the excel sheet. And the better solution for this was actually something like Dropbox rather than a better email. The lesson, some people actually don't know what they need. Observation is sometimes a more powerful tool to come up with solutions than questions.
